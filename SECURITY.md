# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Stradl currently supports security fixes for the latest `main` branch only.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please report security vulnerabilities privately.

Preferred method:
1. Use GitHub's private vulnerability reporting flow (Security tab -> Report a vulnerability).
2. Include clear reproduction steps, impact, and affected versions/commit SHA if known.

If private vulnerability reporting is not available, contact the repository owner directly:
- https://github.com/svakili

Please do not open public GitHub issues for security vulnerabilities.

## Response Expectations

- Initial triage acknowledgement: within 3 business days
- Follow-up with status/severity: within 7 business days
- Remediation timeline depends on impact and complexity

We will coordinate disclosure timing with reporters whenever possible.
